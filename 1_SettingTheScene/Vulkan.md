The standards body [Khronos](https://www.khronos.org/) released the successor to OpenGL, Vulkan-1.0 in February 2016, ushering in the next generation of Open, Cross Platform API for graphics and compute.

### Pros:
* Very low CPU overhead enables low power consumption and higher performance.

* Multi-threaded for modern CPUs and GPUs:
Designed from the ground up for multi-threading, with state localized within command buffers and explicit synchronisation primitives.

* Cross platform: [source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan)
"Vulkan runs natively on Android, Linux, BSD Unix, QNX, Haiku, Nintendo Switch, Raspberry Pi, Stadia, Fuchsia, Tizen, and Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11.  MoltenVK provides freely-licensed third-party support for macOS, iOS and tvOS by wrapping over Apple's Metal API."

* Runtime extension system, enabling fine-grained support for latest hardware features, including:
    * Ray Tracing
    * Mesh Shaders

* Vulkan layers that can be enabled at runtime:
    * Validation layers
    * API output layers
    * Best practise guides

### Cons:

* Low level, responsibility for many tasks moves from driver into application scope.
Developers must explicitly configure settings, allocate and manage memory, manage transfering of data to/from GPU and dispatching and synchronizing CPU and GPU operations.

* Requires more knowledge and code to implement even simple features - 1500 lines of code to just render a textured triangle!

### Useful links:

* [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) LUNARG's website containing the VulkanSDK -
provides a single package with headers and libs for Windows, Linux and macOS.
